Dear Sanket,

I hope this letter finds you well. There are some things I've been meaning to share with you, things that I haven't been able to express openly.

First and foremost, I want you to know how much you mean to me. Your presence in my life has brought immense joy and warmth, and I cherish every moment we spend together.

There's something special about the way you smile, the way your eyes light up when you talk about your passions. It's as if the whole world brightens whenever you're around.

But there's also a part of me that hesitates, that holds back from revealing everything I feel. Perhaps it's the fear of vulnerability, of laying bare my deepest emotions and risking rejection.

Yet, despite my reservations, I cannot deny the truth: I care about you deeply, more than words can convey. And if you ever find yourself in need of a listening ear or a shoulder to lean on, know that I am here for you, now and always.

With all my affection,
Ritesh
